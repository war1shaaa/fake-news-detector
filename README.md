📰 Fake News Detector using NLP & Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that detects whether a news article is Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a trained classification model.

🚀 Project Overview

Fake news spreads quickly on the internet and can mislead people. This project builds an AI model that analyzes news text and predicts whether it is:

✅ Real News
❌ Fake News

The system uses text preprocessing, vectorization, and a machine learning classifier to make predictions.


🧠 Technologies Used

Python

spaCy – for text cleaning & NLP

scikit-learn – ML model

Pandas – data handling

TF-IDF Vectorizer – text to numbers

Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes – classifier
